# HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage 0 Task

## Team Name: Valine

Welcome to my repository for the HackBio Biocoding Internship! This repository contains my solution for the **Stage Zero Task**, where I introduced my team members using Python.

---

## **What This Repository Contains**

- A Python script named `team_info.py` that prints the details of our team members.
- A `README.md` file (this file) explaining what the code does and the steps I took to complete the task.

## **About the Task**

The task was to write a Python script that prints information about the members of my team, including:
- Name
- Slack Username
- Email
- Hobby
- Country
- Academic Discipline
- Preferred Programming Language

I also included:
- Our **team name** at the top of the output.
- Detailed **comments** explaining each part of the code.

## **Steps to Complete the Task**

1. **Wrote the Python Script**:
   - I created a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one team member.
   - Each dictionary contains the key-value pairs for the member's details.
   - I printed the team name and each member's details with clear separators for readability.
   - Comments were added for every part of the code to make it easier to understand.

2. **Uploaded the Solution to GitHub**:
   - Created an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and a repository named `hackbio-biocoding-internship`.
   - Added a folder named `stage-0` to the repository.
   - Uploaded the `team_info.py` script and this `README.md` file to the `stage-0` folder.

3. **Committed and Pushed the Changes**:
   - Made sure all files were uploaded successfully.
   - Added meaningful commit messages to track the changes.
